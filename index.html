                        It's a nice day isn't it? A new day with fresh breeze under the same sun or moon.<br>
                        This gives you a lot of ideas to do or to make. Sometimes, you can use this opportunity
                        to relax and unwind, simply because, it's just a very nice and slow day. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was wondering, did you ever felt like you've been doing something you love and then
                        in all the sudden reasons, you felt like you were stuck? Like a jammed sewing machine, 
                        or a clugged sink, you know you need to keep moving forward, yet somehow, your mind
                        doesn't listen to you anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I found it really funny. I thought it was just some emotional unstableness or a 
                        sudden retribution of fatigue that could be dealt or managed through sleeping or
                        relaxing, but as you continue to ignore it, you just one day find yourself nose-dived
                        into a pit full of darkness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>My music stopped responding to me.</span>
                        I felt like it wants to evolve, yet I ignored it and pushed it to some areas
                        that I should be inclined to do. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, I was exposed to a music that is rarely accepted to the music scene in the
                        modern days. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even so, I accepted the fact and tough it out in my junior, secondary and college education.
                        Looking for bands who will be interested with the music I am capable with, but none of them
                        were interested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I thought it would be great to have a band that would love the same music and 
                        appreciate it in the same way that I do, but then again, I am still alone in this
                        music journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I made <span class="red">Archard Deity</span>, it was for the purpose of music production experimentation,
                        to see if I am capable of making songs on my own since I was eager to release the songs that
                        I enjoy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But don't get me wrong, all the songs that I made, I enjoyed making them, 
                        writing, arranging, mixing, mastering and producing. I even got a chance to collaborate
                        with people who has amazing talents on what they do. I am just blown-away and honored.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also got the chance to have a unit <span class="red">Re:Play</span>, and a rock band
                        <span class="red">Rocket Rock Boom</span>. I won't stop making songs with them, since
                        I enjoyed their company and would love to continuously progress with them as long as they allow me to
                        be their Producer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But for the meantime, I can't write songs until I managed to bring back that sound that my music 
                        gives to me. I'll do whatever it takes just to get my sound back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll be practicing on my own again, until then.
                    </p>
